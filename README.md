# Monte Carlo Queue Simulation

This project simulates a queueing system using the Monte Carlo method. It provides insights into system performance, including average waiting time, server utilization, and more.

## Features
- Simulate queueing systems with random arrival and service times.
- Customizable parameters for queue size, number of servers, etc.
- Visualize results with graphs.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/monte-carlo-queue-simulation.git
cd monte-carlo-queue-simulation
pip install -r requirements.txt
